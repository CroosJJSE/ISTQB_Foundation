   - Testing verifies that the software meets **functional**, **security**, and **reliability** standards.

3. **Improve User Experience**:
   - Testing ensures the software works as intended, providing a smooth and reliable experience for users.

4. **Mitigate Risks**:
   - Testing acts as a **preventative measure** to reduce risks like security breaches, data loss, or system crashes.

---

## Testing vs. Quality Assurance (QA)
- **Quality Assurance (QA)**:
  - A **broader process** that ensures high standards throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
  
- **Testing**:
  - A **specific activity** within QA that evaluates the product to ensure it meets quality benchmarks.

---

## Key Terms in Testing
- **Root Cause**: The underlying reason for a defect.
- **Error**: A mistake made by a developer during coding.
- **Defect**: A flaw in the software caused by an error.
- **Failure**: When the system does not work as expected due to a defect.

---

## How Testing Works
1. **Identify Errors**: Developers make mistakes (errors) during coding.
2. **Detect Defects**: Testing reveals flaws (defects) in the software caused by errors.
3. **Prevent Failures**: Fixing defects ensures the system works as expected, avoiding failures.

---

---# Testing Principles - Quick Revision Notes

This section covers the **7 fundamental testing principles** that guide effective software testing.

---

## The 7 Testing Principles
1. **Testing Shows the Presence of Defects**:
   - Testing helps find bugs, but it **cannot prove** that the software is completely bug-free.
   - Focus: Uncover defects, not prove perfection.

2. **Exhaustive Testing is Impossible**:
   - It’s impractical to test every possible scenario.
   - Focus on **high-risk areas** and **priority features**.

3. **Early Testing Saves Time and Money**:
   - Defects found early in the development process are **cheaper and easier** to fix.
   - Example: Fixing a small leak before it becomes a flood.

4. **Defects Cluster Together**:
   - Most bugs are concentrated in a **few parts** of the system.
   - Focus testing efforts on areas with the **highest defect density**.

5. **Pesticide Paradox**:
   - Repeated use of the same tests makes them **less effective** at finding new bugs.
   - Regularly **review and update** test cases to keep them effective.

6. **Testing is Context-Dependent**:
   - Testing approaches vary based on the **type of software**.
   - Example: Testing an e-commerce website is different from testing a medical device.

7. **Absence of Errors is a Fallacy**:
   - Even if no defects are found, the software may still fail to meet **user needs**.
   - Focus: Ensure the software is **useful** and meets requirements, not just bug-free.

---

## Key Takeaways for Interviews
- Testing principles help focus on **finding important bugs early** and **adapting to the project context**.
- Understand and explain the **7 principles** in your own words.
- Emphasize the importance of **early testing**, **risk-based testing**, and **user-centric testing**.
